Assignment:
 
Create GitHub repository.
Create Angular 1.5.8 website.
Default URL site should redirect you to a registry form.
URL ('/register') is a subsite with input form that has the following inputs: Name, LastName, Address, and Date of birth.
Submit button ('Register') should save all the input data with additional date of creation to indexedDB, if the age of the applicant is higher than 21 years.
If indexedDB has data, 'Hello, LastName Name!' should appear in the top left corner.
If Date of birth is Friday, the background should change to green.
 
optional:
Create ASP.NET Web Api project.
Submit button ('Register') should send all the input data to the server in json format
All the data must be saved in the local database


You should create this as Enterprise level application. Use of e2e test, unit tests, TypeScript and Angular Material Design are not required but are preferable. For the optional part you can use any database engine or ORM tool. SOLID or other programming patterns are not required but are preferable.
